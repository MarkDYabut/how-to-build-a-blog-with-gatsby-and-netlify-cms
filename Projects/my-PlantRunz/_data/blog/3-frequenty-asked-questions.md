# What is PlantRunz?

Plantrunz is a service in the Greater Toronto Area that picks up plants on your behalf from growers, nurseries and garden centers then delivers them to you .

We know that there are numerous nurseries and garden centres that are "hard to get to” via public transportation, especially for those that do not have access to a personal vehicle. We want to provide everyone with access to the plants they want.

## How does it work?

**Pick up & Deliver**

Purchase your desired plants online through the garden centre or plant nursery’s website. Contact us afterwards to let us know you’ve made an order that is ready for pickup and delivery.

**Shop & Deliver**

If online ordering and payment is not possible, let us know what plants you are looking for and we will start a wishlist for you. When we do our scheduled nursery visits, we will contact you if they are available before we purchase them on your behalf.

For both options, schedule a delivery and wait for your new plant baby or babies to come to you.

## What are the services and how much does it cost?

Starts at $15 for up to 3 plants.  Will range between $15 - \$35 Pricing will vary on the number of plants & which nursery the plants are picked up and where you are located.

Message us for an exact quotation.

**\*Custom pricing available for unlisted options. Send us a message with your inquiry.**

## How does the payment process work?

We require a pre-payment for the service charges via e-transfer sent to plantrunz@gmail.com
