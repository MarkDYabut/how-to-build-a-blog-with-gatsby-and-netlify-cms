# Let's examine what each of these fields does:
# name:  This one is used in routes like /admin/collections/blog
# label: This one is used in the UI (User Interface). When you are in the admin page,
#   you will see a big word "Blog" on the top of the screen. That big word "Blog" is the label.
# folder: This one points to the file path where your blog posts are stored.
# create: This one lets the user (you or whoever has admin access) create new documents (blog posts in this case) in these collections.
# slug: This one is the template for filenames. {{year}}, {{month}}, and {{day}} which are pulled from the post's date field or save date.
#   {{slug}} is a URL-safe version of the post's title. By default it is {{slug}}.
